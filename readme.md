> WatchTower stands as the first layer of user security on Solana. 
Our mission? To shield every Solana user from potential hacks and scams. 

At its core, WatchTower analyses user wallets, pinpointing scam, spam, or authentic NFTs, and provides real-time alerts along with a confidence score. This is made possible by our bespoke ML model, meticulously tailored to Solana NFT standards, boasting a staggering 99.8% accuracy.

As we look ahead, our roadmap is brimming with innovation. Expect a diverse suite of tools, from chrome extensions and batch processing APIs to zk relayers and more. Our commitment remains steadfast: ensuring users have a seamless and secure journey on Solana.
